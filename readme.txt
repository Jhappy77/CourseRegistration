To run the application, launch the server from Server.java, and any clients from MyGUI.java

You can switch between the PseudoDB and RealDB at line 76 in Server.java, however since
RealDB uses the database hosted using MySQL on one of our laptops, you will be better off using PseudoDB to test.

Instructions for making JavaFX executable from Eclipse are included at line 38 in MyGUI.java
